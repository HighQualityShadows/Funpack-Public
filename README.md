This is my first modpack that Im actually being organized with but I am pretty knowledgeable on modded minecraft and tech in general. The whole modpack idea came from making a more flushed out pack with all the mods I have found fun in servers I have hosted for my friend group. Forge 1.20.1 Plans:

Custom end game dimension that Ice and Fire and Gregtech stuff is locked to spawn in.
Everything tweaked to keep a vanilla-like progression.
Quests for most things in the game that are hidden til completion to encourage trying stuff. Each quest will include a description with more info on whatever the quest was for.
Removing all conflicting items possible.
Made to work well on servers with combat enabled and no land claims. Implementing other ways to achieve these features; For example a forcefield mod instead of land claims.
Possibly implementing a custom mod to integrate simply swords for all the already existing weapons.
Custom ores since the existing ore mods are not meeting my needs.

Completed:

Performance mods
Biome selection for overworld (Using Biomes O' Plenty and Regions Unexplored but tweaked to remove overlapping and bad biomes)
Basic outline and mod selection
Mobs spawns for each biome
Custom recipes and balloon weight set for valkriean skies to prevent airships being used very early game.
FTB ultimine tweaked for balance.
